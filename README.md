# Location_Weatherapp
*This is an android app that uses the Open Weather Map API to show the user weather information in his/her current location.
*Should update it to become automated - fetch user's location using maps
*As of now the location is hardcoded into the fragment as a string coz I don't posses a Google Maps API key. 
Should acquire one soon and update the app.
